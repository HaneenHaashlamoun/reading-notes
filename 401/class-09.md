# Magic methods

![magic](https://miro.medium.com/max/858/0*2kK045uR9_TrTMCF.png)

Magic methods are special methods that you can define to add 'magic' to your classes. They are always surrounded by double underscores, for example, the `__init__` and `__str__` magic methods. Magic methods can enrich our class design by giving us access to Python's built-in syntax features.

## Object Initialization: `__init__`

Right upon starting my class I already need a special method. To construct account objects from the Account class I need a constructor which in Python is the __init__ dunder.

## Object Representation: `__str__, __repr__`

It’s common practice in Python to provide a string representation of your object for the consumer of your class (a bit like API documentation.) There are two ways to do this using dunder methods

- `__repr__`: The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of `__repr__` is to be unambiguous.

- `__str__`: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser.

## Iteration: `__len__, __getitem__, __reversed__`

In order to iterate over our account object I need to add some transactions. So first, I’ll define a simple method to add transactions. I’ll keep it simple because this is just setup code to explain dunder methods, and not a production-ready accounting system

## Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts: `__eq__, __lt__`

## Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts: `__add__` 

In Python, everything is an object. We are completely fine adding two integers or two strings with the + (plus) operator.

## Callable Python Objects: `__call__`
You can make an object callable like a regular function by adding the `__call__` dunder method. For our account class we could print a nice report of all the transactions that make up its balance

## Context Manager Support and the With Statement: `__enter__, __exit__`

A context manager is a simple “protocol” (or interface) that your object needs to follow so it can be used with the with statement. Basically all you need to do is add `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to an object if you want it to function as a context manager.

# What is probability? (Statistics - Probability)

Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur in a Random Experiment. Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1, where, loosely speaking, 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty. The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur.

## From statistics to probability

Our data will be generated by flipping a coin 10 times and counting how many times we get heads. We will call a set of 10 coin tosses a trial. Our data point will be the number of heads we observe. We may not get the “ideal” 5 heads, but we won’t worry too much since one trial is only one data point. If we perform many, many trials, we expect the average number of heads over all of our trials to approach the 50%. The code below simulates 10, 100, 1000, and 1000000 trials, and then calculates the average proportion of heads observed.


## The data and the distribution

In a probability context, the high point in a normal distribution represents the event with the highest probability of occurring. As you get farther away from this event on either side, the probability drops rapidly, forming that familiar bell-shape. The high point in a statistical context actually represents the mean. As in probability, as you get farther from the mean, you rapidly drop off in frequency. That is to say, extremely high and low deviations from the mean are present but exceedingly rare.

## Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

In probability theory, the central limit theorem establishes that, in many situations, when independent random variables are summed up, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed.

## Three Sigma Rule

In statistics, the 68–95–99.7 rule, also known as the empirical rule, is a shorthand used to remember the percentage of values that lie within an interval estimate in a normal distribution: 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of the values lie within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean, respectively.

## Z-score

In statistics, the standard score is the number of standard deviations by which the value of a raw score is above or below the mean value of what is being observed or measured. Raw scores above the mean have positive standard scores, while those below the mean have negative standard scores.
