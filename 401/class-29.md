# Django Custom User

Customizing authentication in Django
The authentication that comes with Django is good enough for most common cases, but you may have needs not met by the out-of-the-box defaults. Customizing authentication in your projects requires understanding what points of the provided system are extensible or replaceable. This document provides details about how the auth system can be customized.

Authentication backends provide an extensible system for when a username and password stored with the user model need to be authenticated against a different service than Django’s default.

You can give your models custom permissions that can be checked through Django’s authorization system.

You can extend the default User model, or substitute a completely customized model.

Other authentication sources¶
There may be times you have the need to hook into another authentication source – that is, another source of usernames and passwords or authentication methods.

For example, your company may already have an LDAP setup that stores a username and password for every employee. It’d be a hassle for both the network administrator and the users themselves if users had separate accounts in LDAP and the Django-based applications.

So, to handle situations like this, the Django authentication system lets you plug in other authentication sources. You can override Django’s default database-based scheme, or you can use the default system in tandem with other systems.

See the authentication backend reference for information on the authentication backends included with Django.

Specifying authentication backends¶
Behind the scenes, Django maintains a list of “authentication backends” that it checks for authentication. When somebody calls django.contrib.auth.authenticate() – as described in How to log a user in – Django tries authenticating across all of its authentication backends. If the first authentication method fails, Django tries the second one, and so on, until all backends have been attempted.

The list of authentication backends to use is specified in the AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS setting. This should be a list of Python path names that point to Python classes that know how to authenticate. These classes can be anywhere on your Python path.

By default, AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS is set to:
```
['django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend']
```

That’s the basic authentication backend that checks the Django users database and queries the built-in permissions. It does not provide protection against brute force attacks via any rate limiting mechanism. You may either implement your own rate limiting mechanism in a custom auth backend, or use the mechanisms provided by most Web servers.

The order of AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS matters, so if the same username and password is valid in multiple backends, Django will stop processing at the first positive match.

If a backend raises a PermissionDenied exception, authentication will immediately fail. Django won’t check the backends that follow.

Note

Once a user has authenticated, Django stores which backend was used to authenticate the user in the user’s session, and re-uses the same backend for the duration of that session whenever access to the currently authenticated user is needed. This effectively means that authentication sources are cached on a per-session basis, so if you change AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS, you’ll need to clear out session data if you need to force users to re-authenticate using different methods. A simple way to do that is to execute Session.objects.all().delete().

## Writing an authentication backend
An authentication backend is a class that implements two required methods: get_user(user_id) and authenticate(request, **credentials), as well as a set of optional permission related authorization methods.

The get_user method takes a user_id – which could be a username, database ID or whatever, but has to be the primary key of your user object – and returns a user object or None.

The authenticate method takes a request argument and credentials as keyword arguments. Most of the time, it’ll look like this:
```
from django.contrib.auth.backends import BaseBackend

class MyBackend(BaseBackend):
    def authenticate(self, request, username=None, password=None):
        # Check the username/password and return a user.
        ...
```

But it could also authenticate a token, like so:

```
from django.contrib.auth.backends import BaseBackend

class MyBackend(BaseBackend):
    def authenticate(self, request, token=None):
        # Check the token and return a user.
        ...
```

Either way, authenticate() should check the credentials it gets and return a user object that matches those credentials if the credentials are valid. If they’re not valid, it should return None.

request is an HttpRequest and may be None if it wasn’t provided to authenticate() (which passes it on to the backend).

The Django admin is tightly coupled to the Django User object. The best way to deal with this is to create a Django User object for each user that exists for your backend (e.g., in your LDAP directory, your external SQL database, etc.) You can either write a script to do this in advance, or your authenticate method can do it the first time a user logs in.

Here’s an example backend that authenticates against a username and password variable defined in your settings.py file and creates a Django User object the first time a user authenticates:
```
from django.conf import settings
from django.contrib.auth.backends import BaseBackend
from django.contrib.auth.hashers import check_password
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class SettingsBackend(BaseBackend):
    """
    Authenticate against the settings ADMIN_LOGIN and ADMIN_PASSWORD.

    Use the login name and a hash of the password. For example:

    ADMIN_LOGIN = 'admin'
    ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'pbkdf2_sha256$30000$Vo0VlMnkR4Bk$qEvtdyZRWTcOsCnI/oQ7fVOu1XAURIZYoOZ3iq8Dr4M='
    """

    def authenticate(self, request, username=None, password=None):
        login_valid = (settings.ADMIN_LOGIN == username)
        pwd_valid = check_password(password, settings.ADMIN_PASSWORD)
        if login_valid and pwd_valid:
            try:
                user = User.objects.get(username=username)
            except User.DoesNotExist:
                # Create a new user. There's no need to set a password
                # because only the password from settings.py is checked.
                user = User(username=username)
                user.is_staff = True
                user.is_superuser = True
                user.save()
            return user
        return None

    def get_user(self, user_id):
        try:
            return User.objects.get(pk=user_id)
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return None
```

## Handling authorization in custom backends
Custom auth backends can provide their own permissions.

The user model and its manager will delegate permission lookup functions (get_user_permissions(), get_group_permissions(), get_all_permissions(), has_perm(), has_module_perms(), and with_perm()) to any authentication backend that implements these functions.

The permissions given to the user will be the superset of all permissions returned by all backends. That is, Django grants a permission to a user that any one backend grants.

If a backend raises a PermissionDenied exception in has_perm() or has_module_perms(), the authorization will immediately fail and Django won’t check the backends that follow.

A backend could implement permissions for the magic admin like this:

```
from django.contrib.auth.backends import BaseBackend

class MagicAdminBackend(BaseBackend):
    def has_perm(self, user_obj, perm, obj=None):
        return user_obj.username == settings.ADMIN_LOGIN
```

This gives full permissions to the user granted access in the above example. Notice that in addition to the same arguments given to the associated django.contrib.auth.models.User functions, the backend auth functions all take the user object, which may be an anonymous user, as an argument.

A full authorization implementation can be found in the ModelBackend class in django/contrib/auth/backends.py, which is the default backend and queries the auth_permission table most of the time.

## Authorization for anonymous users
An anonymous user is one that is not authenticated i.e. they have provided no valid authentication details. However, that does not necessarily mean they are not authorized to do anything. At the most basic level, most websites authorize anonymous users to browse most of the site, and many allow anonymous posting of comments etc.

Django’s permission framework does not have a place to store permissions for anonymous users. However, the user object passed to an authentication backend may be an django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser object, allowing the backend to specify custom authorization behavior for anonymous users. This is especially useful for the authors of re-usable apps, who can delegate all questions of authorization to the auth backend, rather than needing settings, for example, to control anonymous access.

## Authorization for inactive users

An inactive user is one that has its is_active field set to False. The ModelBackend and RemoteUserBackend authentication backends prohibits these users from authenticating. If a custom user model doesn’t have an is_active field, all users will be allowed to authenticate.

You can use AllowAllUsersModelBackend or AllowAllUsersRemoteUserBackend if you want to allow inactive users to authenticate.

The support for anonymous users in the permission system allows for a scenario where anonymous users have permissions to do something while inactive authenticated users do not.

Do not forget to test for the is_active attribute of the user in your own backend permission methods.

## Handling object permissions

Django’s permission framework has a foundation for object permissions, though there is no implementation for it in the core. That means that checking for object permissions will always return False or an empty list (depending on the check performed). An authentication backend will receive the keyword parameters obj and user_obj for each object related authorization method and can return the object level permission as appropriate.

## Custom permissions

To create custom permissions for a given model object, use the permissions model Meta attribute.

This example Task model creates two custom permissions, i.e., actions users can or cannot do with Task instances, specific to your application:
```
class Task(models.Model):
    ...
    class Meta:
        permissions = [
            ("change_task_status", "Can change the status of tasks"),
            ("close_task", "Can remove a task by setting its status as closed"),
        ]
```
The only thing this does is create those extra permissions when you run manage.py migrate (the function that creates permissions is connected to the post_migrate signal). Your code is in charge of checking the value of these permissions when a user is trying to access the functionality provided by the application (changing the status of tasks or closing tasks.) Continuing the above example, the following checks if a user may close tasks:

user.has_perm('app.close_task')
Extending the existing User model¶
There are two ways to extend the default User model without substituting your own model. If the changes you need are purely behavioral, and don’t require any change to what is stored in the database, you can create a proxy model based on User. This allows for any of the features offered by proxy models including default ordering, custom managers, or custom model methods.

If you wish to store information related to User, you can use a OneToOneField to a model containing the fields for additional information. This one-to-one model is often called a profile model, as it might store non-auth related information about a site user. For example you might create an Employee model:
```
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Employee(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    department = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```
Assuming an existing Employee Fred Smith who has both a User and Employee model, you can access the related information using Django’s standard related model conventions:
```
>>> u = User.objects.get(username='fsmith')
>>> freds_department = u.employee.department
```
To add a profile model’s fields to the user page in the admin, define an InlineModelAdmin (for this example, we’ll use a StackedInline) in your app’s admin.py and add it to a UserAdmin class which is registered with the User class:
```
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin as BaseUserAdmin
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

from my_user_profile_app.models import Employee
```

# Define an inline admin descriptor for Employee model
# which acts a bit like a singleton
```
class EmployeeInline(admin.StackedInline):
    model = Employee
    can_delete = False
    verbose_name_plural = 'employee'
```

# Define a new User admin
```
class UserAdmin(BaseUserAdmin):
    inlines = (EmployeeInline,)
```

# Re-register UserAdmin
admin.site.unregister(User)
admin.site.register(User, UserAdmin)
These profile models are not special in any way - they are just Django models that happen to have a one-to-one link with a user model. As such, they aren’t auto created when a user is created, but a django.db.models.signals.post_save could be used to create or update related models as appropriate.

Using related models results in additional queries or joins to retrieve the related data. Depending on your needs, a custom user model that includes the related fields may be your better option, however, existing relations to the default user model within your project’s apps may justify the extra database load.

Substituting a custom User model¶
Some kinds of projects may have authentication requirements for which Django’s built-in User model is not always appropriate. For instance, on some sites it makes more sense to use an email address as your identification token instead of a username.

Django allows you to override the default user model by providing a value for the AUTH_USER_MODEL setting that references a custom model:

> `AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'myapp.MyUser'`

This dotted pair describes the name of the Django app (which must be in your INSTALLED_APPS), and the name of the Django model that you wish to use as your user model.

Using a custom user model when starting a project¶
If you’re starting a new project, it’s highly recommended to set up a custom user model, even if the default User model is sufficient for you. This model behaves identically to the default user model, but you’ll be able to customize it in the future if the need arises:
```
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

class User(AbstractUser):
    pass
```
Don’t forget to point AUTH_USER_MODEL to it. Do this before creating any migrations or running manage.py migrate for the first time.

Also, register the model in the app’s admin.py:
```
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin
from .models import User

admin.site.register(User, UserAdmin)
```

## Changing to a custom user model mid-project

Changing AUTH_USER_MODEL after you’ve created database tables is significantly more difficult since it affects foreign keys and many-to-many relationships, for example.

This change can’t be done automatically and requires manually fixing your schema, moving your data from the old user table, and possibly manually reapplying some migrations. See #25313 for an outline of the steps.

Due to limitations of Django’s dynamic dependency feature for swappable models, the model referenced by AUTH_USER_MODEL must be created in the first migration of its app (usually called 0001_initial); otherwise, you’ll have dependency issues.

In addition, you may run into a CircularDependencyError when running your migrations as Django won’t be able to automatically break the dependency loop due to the dynamic dependency. If you see this error, you should break the loop by moving the models depended on by your user model into a second migration. (You can try making two normal models that have a ForeignKey to each other and seeing how makemigrations resolves that circular dependency if you want to see how it’s usually done.)
