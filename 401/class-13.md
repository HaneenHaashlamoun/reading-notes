# What is Linear Regression?

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.

## Types of Linear Regression

![](https://favtutor.com/resources/images/uploads/Types_of_Regression.jpg)

- Simple linear regression
1 dependent variable (interval or ratio), 1 independent variable (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

- Multiple linear regression
1 dependent variable (interval or ratio) , 2+ independent variables (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

- Logistic regression
1 dependent variable (dichotomous), 2+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

- Ordinal regression
1 dependent variable (ordinal), 1+ independent variable(s) (nominal or dichotomous)

- Multinomial regression
1 dependent variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

- Discriminant analysis
1 dependent variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio)

## Assumptions of a Linear Regression

Statistics Solutions can assist with your quantitative analysis by assisting you to develop your methodology and results chapters. The services that we offer include:

## Data Analysis Plan

- Edit your research questions and null/alternative hypotheses

- Write your data analysis plan; specify specific statistics to address the research questions, the assumptions of the statistics, and justify why they are the appropriate statistics; provide references

- Justify your sample size/power analysis, provide references

- Explain your data analysis plan to you so you are comfortable and confident

- Two hours of additional support with your statistician

## Quantitative Results Section (Descriptive Statistics, Bivariate and Multivariate Analyses, Structural Equation Modeling, Path analysis, HLM, Cluster Analysis)

- Clean and code dataset

- Conduct descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation, frequency and percent, as appropriate)

- Conduct analyses to examine each of your research questions

- Write-up results

- Provide APA 6th edition tables and figures

- Explain chapter 4 findings

- Ongoing support for entire results chapter statistics
