### What is Random Module ?
Python Random module is an in-built module of Python which is used to generate random numbers. These are pseudo-random numbers means these are not truly random. This module can be used to perform random actions such as generating random numbers, print random a value for a list or string, etc.

### When to use it?
We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc. When making your password database more secure or powering a random page feature of your website.

### Random functions

- Randint : randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number.
- Random : Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.
- Shuffle : The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.
- Randrange : Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

# What is Risk Analysis

Risk analysis is the process of identifying and analyzing potential issues that could negatively impact key business initiatives or projects. This process is done in order to help organizations avoid or mitigate those risks.

## Why use Risk Analysis?
In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.

possible risks that you could encounter?

- Use of new hardware
- Use of new technology
- Use of new automation tool
- The sequence of code
- Availability of test resources for the application

certain risks that are unavoidable. I am enumerating them below:

- The time that you allocated for testing
- A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application
- Urgency from the clients to deliver the project
- Incomplete requirements 

In such cases, you have to tackle the situation with care. Following points can be taken care of:

- Conduct Risk Assessment review meeting
- Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas
- Create a Risk Assessment database for future use
- Identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators: high, medium, low.

**High**: means the effect of the risk would be very high and non-tolerable. The company might face loss.

**Medium**: it is tolerable but not desirable. The company may suffer financially but there is a limited risk.

**Low**: it is tolerable. There lies little or no external exposure or no financial loss.


## Risk Assessment
In the risk analysis process, these steps prove to be the most important one. It is said that this step is way too complex and should be tackled with the utmost care. After risk identification, assessment has to be dealt programmatically. There are a few perspectives on risk assessment.
