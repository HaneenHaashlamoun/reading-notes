### What is HTML?

Known as “Hypertext Markup Language”, it is a standardised system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphic and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web (WWW) pages.
Other technologies besides HTML are used to describe a web page's look (CSS) or interaction (JavaScript).

### First step

first step is always to make a wireframe for the site your making,
and here is a [link](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/) to help you learn more about your wireframe.

### Semantics

Then you need to learn and know Semantics of the tags used in HTML.
and to know how to use it properly for example :


- <!DOCTYPE html>
- <html>
- <head>
- <title>Page Title</title>
- </head>
- <body>

- <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
- <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

- </body>
- </html>

Semantic elements
These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available:

- <article>
- <aside>
- <details>
- <figcaption>
- <figure>
- <footer>
- <header>
- <main>
- <mark>
- <nav>
- <section>
- <summary>
- <time>


these are some of the main tags you may want to learn.
