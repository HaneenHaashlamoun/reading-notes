# JavaScript (JS)

## What is JavaScript (JS)

JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful

The four essential parts acts should be done by JavaScript are:
- Access the content of the page
- Modify the content of the page
- Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
- React to events triggered by the user or browser



The main acts of JavaScript must be shown in the next examples:

- SLIDESHOWS *example: They allow more content to be displayed within a limited amount of space*.

- Forms *example: Validating forms*.

- RELOAD PART OF PAGE *example: Just reloading a section of the page can make a site feel like it is faster to load and  more like an application.*

- FILTERING DATA *example: buttons are generated using data  in the attributes of the HTML `<img>` elements. When the  user clicks on one of the buttons, they are only shown the  images with that keyword.*

----------------------- 

## What is a Script and how do we write it ?
A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.
You could compare scripts to any of the following:

- **RECIPES:** Some scripts are simple and only deal with  one individual scenario, like a simple recipe for a basic dish. Other scripts can perform many tasks, like a recipe  for a complicated three-course meal.

- **HANDBOOKS:** For example, hotel handbooks may contain  steps to follow in different scenarios such as when a guest  checks in, when a room needs to be tidied, when a f ire alarm goes off, and so forth. 

- **MANUALS:** scripts can allow the browser to check the current situation and only perform a set of steps if that  action is appropriate.

-----------------

## WRITING A SCRIPT

To write a script, you need to first state your goal and  then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and  break that down into smaller steps.

1. DEFINE THE GOAL: First, you need to define the task you want to achieve.

2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT: To design a script you split the goal  out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in  solving this puzzle. This can be represented using a  flowchart.

3. CODE EACH STEP: Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript. and each step can be broken into a series of steps.

Just like learning any new language, you need to get to grips with the:
- Vocabulary: The words that computers understand
- Syntax: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow

You need to learn to "think" like a computer because they  solve tasks in different ways than you or I might approach  them; Computers solve problems programmatically.

**PS: this is how you read a flowchart.**

**How do computers understand JavaScript**

>COMPUTERS CREATE MODELS OF THE WORLD USING DATA

## OBJECTS & PROPERTIES
*******************************
**OBJECTS (THINGS)**

In computer programming, each physical thing in the world  can be represented as an object. There are two different  types of objects here: a hotel and a car. Programmers might  say that there is one instance of the hotel object, and two  instances of the car object.

Each object can have its own:
- Properties
- Events
- Methods

********************************

**PROPERTIES (CHARACTERISTICS)**

Programmers call these characteristics the properties of an  object.Each property has a name and a value, and each of these name/value pairs tells you something about each individual instance of the object.

![property](https://www.tutsmake.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/JavaScript-Object-Properties.jpeg)

**Together they create a working model of that object.**

**********************************

**EVENTS**

programs are designed to do different things when users  interact with the computer in different ways. For example,  clicking on a contact link on a web page could bring up a  contact form, and entering text into a search box may automatically trigger the search functionality. An event is the computer's way of sticking up its hand to say, "Hey, this just happened!"

![events](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J43C-IwA--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_900,q_auto,w_1600/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/1zm80qaekzgu8p54w98g.jpg)

*******************************

**METHODS**

Methods represent things people need to do with objects.  They can retrieve or update the values of an object's  properties.

WHAT DOES A METHOD DO?

The code for a method can contain lots of instructions that  together represent one task. When you use a method, you do  not always need to know how it achieves its task; you just  need to know how to ask the question and how to interpret any answers it gives you.

*for example: string related methods.*

**********************************

### **CONCLUSION:**

Computers use data to create models of things in the real world.The events, methods, and properties of an object all  relate to each other: Events can trigger methods, and  methods can retrieve or update an object's properties.
