HTML5 comes with elements for embedding rich media in documents — `<video>` and `<audio>` — which in turn come with their own APIs for controlling playback, seeking, etc. This article shows you how to do common tasks such as creating custom playback controls.


for thw video tag :
>`controls.`

If this attribute is present, the browser will offer controls to allow the user to control video playback, including volume, seeking, and pause/resume playback.

This is not as immediately useful for video playback, but it does have advantages. One big issue with the native browser controls is that they are different in each browser — not very good for cross-browser support! Another big issue is that the native controls in most browsers aren't very keyboard-accessible.

You can solve both these problems by hiding the native controls (by removing the `controls` attribute), and programming your own with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the next section we'll look at the basic tools we have available to do this.

## The HTMLMediaElement API
Part of the HTML5 spec, the HTMLMediaElement API provides features to allow you to control video and audio players programmatically — for example `HTMLMediaElement.play()`, `HTMLMediaElement.pause()`, etc. This interface is available to both `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, as the features you'll want to implement are nearly identical. Let's go through an example, adding features as we go.

SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject.
The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can
improve your website's visibility on search engines.


- The Basics : Search engine optimization (or
SEO) is the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer
the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics
that your website covers.

- On-Page Techniques : The main component of this is
looking at keywords that people
are likely to enter into a search
engine if they wanted to find
your site, and then including
these in the text and HTML code
for your site in order to help the
search engines know that your
site covers these topics.

- Off-Page Techniques : Search engines also look at the
words between the opening
`<a>` tag and closing `</a>` tag
in the link. If the text in the link
contains keywords (rather than
just click here or your website
address) it may be considered
more relevant.

### Analytics: Learning about your Visitors

As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing
how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are
leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by
Google called Google Analytics.

- Search engine optimization h XX elps visitors find your
sites when using search engines.
-  Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to
see how many people visit your site, how they find it,
and what they do when they get there.
-  To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a
domain name and web hosting.
- FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your
local computer to your web server.
- Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email
newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website
tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
