**What is problem Domain ?**

A problem domain is the area of expertise or application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. A problem domain is simply looking at only the topics of an individual's interest, and excluding everything else. ... This points to a limitation of an overly specific, or overly bounded, problem domain.

**What is the DOM?**
The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. ... The DOM is designed to be used with any programming language.

**WHAT IS AN OBJECT?**
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

- IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
- IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS

![object](https://i0.wp.com/techvidvan.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/java-class-objects.jpg?fit=802%2C420&ssl=1)


**In JavaScript**, an object can be thought of as a distinct entity that can have properties associated with it. These properties define the object’s characteristics and behavior. In our person example, an object can have 4 properties describing it — first name, last name, DOB, and friends.

### THIS (IT IS A KEYWORD)

The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects.
Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers
to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.
