### What is HTML?

Known as “Hypertext Markup Language”, it is a standardised system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphic and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web (WWW) pages. Other technologies besides HTML are used to describe a web page’s look (CSS) or interaction (JavaScript).
HTML job is to describes the structure of pages.
The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled
brackets (`<>`) ; Tags are often referred to as elements.
Tags usually come in pairs (example : `<p></p>`). The opening tag (`<p>`)and the closing tag (`</p>`) , Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.



### Structure of HTML Page 
#### **Body, Head & Title**

*for example :*


`<html>`

`<head>`

`<title> Title of the Page </title>`

`</head>`

`<body>`

`<h2> Sub-Heading </h2>`

`<h1> Heading </h1>`

`<p> Paragraph <p>`

`</body>`

`</html>`

#### **Tags Attributes** 

**Attributes define additional characteristics or properties of the element such as width and height of an image. Attributes are always specified in the start tag (or opening tag) and usually consists of name/value pairs like name="value" . Attribute values should always be enclosed in quotation marks.**
