# Images

There are several things to consider when selecting and
preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them
right will make it look more attractive and professional.
In this chapter you will learn how to:

- Include an image in your web pages using HTML
- Pick which image format to use
- Show an image at the right size
- Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages
load faster.

**Image Tag : `<img>`**

- You will also often see an `<img>`
element use two other attributes
that specify its size:
height and width .


#### *Three Rules for Creating Images*

There are three rules to remember when you
are creating images for your website which are
summarized below. We go into greater detail
on each topic over the next nine pages.

1. Save images in
the right format

2. Save images at
the right size

3. Use the correct
resolution


#### *Image Dimensions*

The images you use on your website should be
saved at the same width and height that you
want them to appear on the page.

#### *Image Resolution*

Images created for the web should be saved at
a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution
of the image, the larger the size of the file.

#### *Animated GIFs*

Animated GIFs show several frames of an
image in sequence and therefore can be used to
create simple animations.

- **Color**
- **rgb values**
- **hex codes**
- **Color names**

**background-color:**
CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.

**Hue**
Hue is near to the colloquial idea
of color. Technically speaking
however, a color can also have
saturation and brightness as
well as hue.

**Saturation**
Saturation refers to the amount
of gray in a color. At maximum
saturation, there would be no
gray in the color. At minimum
saturation, the color would be
mostly gray.

**Brightness**
Brightness (or "value") refers
to how much black is in a color.
At maximum brightness, there
would be no black in the color.
At minimum brightness, the
color would be very dark.

**Contrast**
When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.

# TEXT

![text](https://www.w3schools.com/css/serif.gif)

- There are properties to control t XX he choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.
- There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.
- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.
- You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.

### **Tl;dr**

 or tldr stands for “too long; didn't read.” While the internet acronym can criticize a piece of writing as overly long, it often is used to give a helpful, witty, or snarky summary of a much longer story or complicated phenomenon.
