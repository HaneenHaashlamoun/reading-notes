![layout](https://data-flair.training/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/07/HTML-Layout-df.jpg)

HTML Layouts. HTML layouts provide a way to arrange web pages in well-mannered, well-structured, and in responsive form or we can say that HTML layout specifies a way in which the web pages can be arranged. Web-page layout works with arrangement of visual elements of an HTML document.

#### Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

- Block-level elements
start on a new line
Examples include:
`<h1>` `<p>` `<ul>` `<li>`

- Inline elements
flow in between
surrounding text
Examples include:
`<img>` `<b>` `<i>`


#### Containing Elements

If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

#### Controll ing the Position of Elements

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

- Normal flow
- Relative Positioning
- Absolute positioning


### Normal Flow

## **z-index**

>When you move
any element from
normal flow, boxes
can overlap. The
z-index property
allows you to control
which box appears
on top.

## Floating Elements

The float property allows you
to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing
element as possible.

## Screen Resolution

Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

## Fixed Width Layouts

Fixed width layout
designs do not
change size as the
user increases
or decreases
the size of their
browser window.
Measurements tend
to be given in pixels.

## Liquid Layouts

Liquid layout designs
stretch and contract
as the user increases
or decreases the
size of their browser
window. They tend to
use percentages.
