# HTML Forms

---------------------------------------

Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred
to a printed document that contains
spaces for you to fill in information.

## Why Forms?
![why](https://img.webnots.com/2014/01/How-HTML-Form-Works.png)

The `<form>` HTML element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.

There are several types of form controls that
you can use to collect information from visitors
to your site.

Form controls live inside a
`<form>` element. This element
should always carry the action
attribute and will usually have a
method and id attribute too.

- **action** 
Every `<form>` element requires
an action attribute. Its value
is the URL for the page on the
server that will receive the
information in the form when it
is submitted.

- **method**
Forms can be sent using one of
two methods: get or post.

- Whenever you want to c XX ollect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
`<form>` element.
- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
- Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.
- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms.

- In addition to the CSS p XX roperties covered in other
chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
- List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.
- Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.
- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.
- Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.

in your JavaScript code.

When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three
steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code.
Together these steps are known as event handling.
