**Defining a Domain Model**
What is a domain model?

Domain model is a structured visual representation of interconnected concepts or real-world objects that incorporates vocabulary, key concepts, behavior, and relationships of all of its entities.
The key word in the above definition for me personally is visual. My brain performs at a maximum if a theoretical concept can be visualized in a digestible and somewhat eye-pleasing manner. Most of the time a domain model is illustrated with a set of class diagrams which may show:

- domain objects or conceptual classes
- associations between conceptual classes
- attributes of conceptual classes

**Define a constructor and initialize properties**

To define the same properties between many objects, you'll want to use a constructor function. Below is a table that summarizes a JavaScript representation of an EpicFailVideo object.

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

## HTML TABLES
A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.
What's a Table?

- The `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web
page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the `<tr>` element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the `<td>` element (or `<th>` if it is a
header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>`,
`<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.

## CREATING OBJECTS USING CONSTRUCTOR SYNTAX

Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
