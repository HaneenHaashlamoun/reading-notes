## definition 

Is a way of modern thinking to prevent laziness and to improve work results and other aspects of one’s life. Basically it’s a way to change your perspective to certain things that can pull you down and lower your results and benefits you get of practicing work or other activities.
Essentially it is not defined in actions necessarily; it mostly is defined by how you take things in your mind reactions in another words. And make your thoughts more helpful and positive than just stopping and quitting.

There is a lot of ways to apply this way of thinking in your everyday life some of these examples are:
1.	The first is to start embracing the challenges you have instead of avoiding them.
2.	Facing the obstacles with concentration and not lose your focus or interest with the task.
3.	Try to embrace effort and what comes out of it (no pain no gain); and not be lazy or afraid of putting some effort in tasks.
4.	Deal more positively with criticism and do not take it as if they were just personal.
5.	Look up to people who are successful around you and not in jealous way; try to learn from them.


You can change the static thinking you’re putting yourself in by doing something fun and diversion of the task you think is putting you in static thinking. Personally there is a lot of activities I do to put me in growth mindset here are some examples:
•	Going for a walk.
•	Have a snack.
•	Take a shower.
