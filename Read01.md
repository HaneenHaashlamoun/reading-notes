## Difinition

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

MarkDown is written files with the .md or .markdown extension.

It's very easy to make some words ** **bold** ** and other words * *italic* *  with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)
