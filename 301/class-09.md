## What is functional programming?
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
A pure function is a function which: Given the same input, always returns the same output. Produces no side effects.

## What are the benefits of a pure function?
Pure functions are much easier to read and reason about. All relevant inputs and dependencies are provided as parameters, so no effects are observed that alter variables outside of the set of inputs. This means that we can quickly understand a function and its dependencies, just by reading the function's declaration.

## What is immutability?
In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This is in contrast to a mutable object, which can be modified after it is created.

## What is Referential transparency?
Referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of parts of computer programs. An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior.

## What is a module?
any of a number of distinct but interrelated units from which a program may be built up or into which a complex activity may be analysed.

## What does the word ‘require’ do?
The require() method is used to load and cache JavaScript modules. So, if you want to load a local, relative JavaScript module into a Node.

## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
To import our own Node JS module. var arthmetic = require("arthmetic");
To import existing Node JS Module. Import Node JS “express” module; var arthmetic = require("express"); Import Node JS “mongoose” module; var mongoose = require("mongoose");
