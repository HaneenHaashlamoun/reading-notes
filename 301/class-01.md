### What is a Component?
A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

### Characteristics of Components

- Reusability

- Replaceable

- Not context specific

- Extensible

- Encapsulated

- Independent

### Advantages

- Ease of deployment

- Reduced cost

- Ease of development

- Reusable

- Modification of technical complexity

- Reliability

- System maintenance and evolution

- Independent
