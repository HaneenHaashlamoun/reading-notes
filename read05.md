#### Expressions (Difinition) :

Expressions perform specific actions, based on an operator, with one or two operands. An operand can be a constant, a variable or a function result. Operators are arithmetic, logical, and relational.

#### Operators (Difinition) :

JavaScript also includes operators same as the other programming languages. An operator operates on single or multiple operands (data values) and produces a result. For example, 1 + 2 adds two numeric values and produces a result (3 in this case). Here, the + sign is an operator, and 1 and 2 are operands. JavaScript operators assign and compare values, perform arithmetic operations, etc. An operator can easily manipulate a certain value or operand. Operators perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands. In other words, we can say that an operator operates on the operands. JavaScript operators compare values, perform arithmetic operations, etc.

### (LOOPS) (Difinition) :

Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is met. The basic idea behind a loop is to automate the repetitive tasks within a program to save the time and effort. JavaScript now supports five different types of loops:

- while — loops through a block of code as long as the condition specified evaluates to true.
- do…while — loops through a block of code once; then the condition is evaluated. If the condition is true, the statement is repeated as long as the specified condition is true.
- for — loops through a block of code until the counter reaches a specified number.
- for…in — loops through the properties of an object.
- for…of — loops over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, etc.
