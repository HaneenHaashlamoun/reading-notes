### Difinition :

CSS is used to control the style of a web document in a simple and easy way.

CSS is the acronym for "Cascading Style Sheet". This tutorial covers both the versions CSS1,CSS2 and CSS3, and gives a complete understanding of CSS, starting from its basics to advanced concepts.

------------------------------------


#### Prerequisites

You should be familiar with:
Basic word processing using any text editor.
How to create directories and files.
How to navigate through different directories.
Internet browsing using popular browsers like Internet Explorer or Firefox.
Developing simple Web Pages using HTML or XHTML.
If you are new to HTML and XHTML, then we would suggest you to go through our HTML Tutorial or XHTML Tutorial first.

### Applications of CSS :

As mentioned before, CSS is one of the most widely used style language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:

- CSS saves time - You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.

- Pages load faster - If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.

- Easy maintenance - To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.

- Superior styles to HTML - CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.

- Multiple Device Compatibility - Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing.

- Global web standards - Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So its a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible to future browsers.

### *CSS priority scheme (highest to lowest):*

| Priority|CSS source type |Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
|1 |Importance |The "!important" annotation overwrites the previous priority types |
|2 |Inline |A style applied to an HTML element via HTML "style" attribute |
|3 |Media Type |A property definition applies to all media types, unless a media specific CSS is defined |
|4 |User defined |Most browsers have the accessibility feature: a user defined CSS |
|5 |Selector specificity |A specific contextual selector (#heading p) overwrites generic definition |
|6 |Rule order |Last rule declaration has a higher priority |
|7 |Parent inheritance |If a property is not specified, it is inherited from a parent element |
|8 |CSS property definition in HTML document |CSS rule or CSS inline style overwrites a default browser value |
|9 |Browser default |The lowest priority: browser default value is determined by W3C initial value specifications
